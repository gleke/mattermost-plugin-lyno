This plugin provides a direct integration of voice channels into Mattermost.
This is made possible by [lyno.io](https://lyno.io) which is using Jitsi as the base.

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. Please feels free to submit a PR/issue.
Unfortunetly it is currently not possible to compile our plugin because some internal libraries are not publicly available yet.
